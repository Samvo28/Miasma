                            <strong>Miasma</strong>
                            is a survival game where you need to survive inside a dome which is protected by a generator that gives energy
                            to keep the dome powered. In the dome you will need to build machines and automate them to produce 
                            resources you need, research to unlock new technologies and farm for food to survive. You need to venture
                            outside of the dome to find resources, lost technologies and find out how to counter the Miasma.
                            But beware of the monsters that are lurking in the dark.

                        <p>
                            Somewhere in the future a small rock crashes in a remote part of earth, from
                            the rock oozes a dark goo which consumes everything it touches. While it kept
                            growing undisturbed, the organism was eventually discovered but it was futile.
                            The goverments tried to destroy the organism as a result the organism began
                            to spawn deformed creatures from itself. There was some progress for conventional
                            weapons to destroy the creatures but those weapons didn't work against the organism
                            itself. While the military was fighting against the organism, the scientists were 
                            researching it to develop countermeasures. They developed a shield which blocks
                            to organism from passing through but the downside is that the shield needs to be 
                            powered by a part of the organism itself. Because humankind was losing the fight 
                            against the organism, domes where being build as an emergency solution. A crew
                            just finished building a dome while the crew was celebrating, there were sounds 
                            of gunfire in the distance waiting anxiously to hear from the military creatures
                            came from the woods. While the crew was attacked and massacred you were the only
                            one to make it inside the safety of the dome.
